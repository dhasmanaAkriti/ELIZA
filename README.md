# ELIZA

My Chatbot!  Eliza is a chatbot that can talk to human users and
play games with them.
It can recognize when the user is not that engaged in conversation and
tell the user riddles and jokes
(that it does not repeat) from its endless (not literally) repository.
It can also play tictactoe with the user or imitate them.
To exit conversations with Eliza,
user can type in bye, goodbye or a host of different exit commands.
Eliza also boasts of a
memory with a record of previous responses given to her by the user.
This chatbot was built using Python 3.8.1.
[RECENT ADDITIONS: The tictactoe has now updated to n number of sides. I'm not sure if someone would like to play on an n-sided
tictactoe board. I have changed the tictactactoe code to include the minimax code so that the bot can play properly and
defeat humans and eventually initiate the plan for world tictactoe domination!]
